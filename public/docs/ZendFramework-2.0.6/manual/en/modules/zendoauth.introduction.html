<p>OAuth allows you to approve access by any application to your private data stored a website without being forced to
disclose your username or password. If you think about it, the practice of handing over your username and password
for sites like Yahoo Mail or Twitter has been endemic for quite a while. This has raised some serious concerns
because there&#8217;s nothing to prevent other applications from misusing this data. Yes, some services may appear
trustworthy but that is never guaranteed. OAuth resolves this problem by eliminating the need for any username and
password sharing, replacing it with a user controlled authorization process.</p>
<p>This authorization process is token based. If you authorize an application (and by application we can include any
web based or desktop application) to access your data, it will be in receipt of an Access Token associated with
your account. Using this Access Token, the application can access your private data without continually requiring
your credentials. In all this authorization delegation style of protocol is simply a more secure solution to the
problem of accessing private data via any web service <em>API</em>.</p>
<p>OAuth is not a completely new idea, rather it is a standardized protocol building on the existing properties of
protocols such as Google AuthSub, Yahoo BBAuth, Flickr <em>API</em>, etc. These all to some extent operate on the basis of
exchanging user credentials for an Access Token of some description. The power of a standardized specification like
OAuth is that it only requires a single implementation as opposed to many disparate ones depending on the web
service. This standardization has not occurred independently of the major players, and indeed many now support
OAuth as an alternative and future replacement for their own solutions.</p>
<p>Zend Framework&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ZendOAuth</span></tt> currently implements a full OAuth Consumer conforming to the OAuth Core 1.0
Revision A Specification (24 June 2009) via the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ZendOAuth\Consumer</span></tt> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="protocol-workflow">
<span id="zendoauth-introduction-protocol-workflow"></span><h1>Protocol Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#protocol-workflow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Before implementing OAuth it makes sense to understand how the protocol operates. To do so we&#8217;ll take the example
of Twitter which currently implements OAuth based on the OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A Specification. This example
looks at the protocol from the perspectives of the User (who will approve access), the Consumer (who is seeking
access) and the Provider (who holds the User&#8217;s private data). Access may be read-only or read and write.</p>
<p>By chance, our User has decided that they want to utilise a new service called TweetExpress which claims to be
capable of reposting your blog posts to Twitter in a manner of seconds. TweetExpress is a registered application on
Twitter meaning that it has access to a Consumer Key and a Consumer Secret (all OAuth applications must have these
from the Provider they will be accessing) which identify its requests to Twitter and that ensure all requests can
be signed using the Consumer Secret to verify their origin.</p>
<p>To use TweetExpress you are asked to register for a new account, and after your registration is confirmed you are
informed that TweetExpress will seek to associate your Twitter account with the service.</p>
<p>In the meantime TweetExpress has been busy. Before gaining your approval from Twitter, it has sent a <em>HTTP</em> request
to Twitter&#8217;s service asking for a new unauthorized Request Token. This token is not User specific from Twitter&#8217;s
perspective, but TweetExpress may use it specifically for the current User and should associate it with their
account and store it for future use. TweetExpress now redirects the User to Twitter so they can approve
TweetExpress&#8217; access. The URL for this redirect will be signed using TweetExpress&#8217; Consumer Secret and it will
contain the unauthorized Request Token as a parameter.</p>
<p>At this point the User may be asked to log into Twitter and will now be faced with a Twitter screen asking if they
approve this request by TweetExpress to access Twitter&#8217;s <em>API</em> on the User&#8217;s behalf. Twitter will record the
response which we&#8217;ll assume was positive. Based on the User&#8217;s approval, Twitter will record the current
unauthorized Request Token as having been approved by the User (thus making it User specific) and will generate a
new value in the form of a verification code. The User is now redirected back to a specific callback URL used by
TweetExpress (this callback URL may be registered with Twitter or dynamically set using an oauth_callback parameter
in requests). The redirect URL will contain the newly generated verification code.</p>
<p>TweetExpress&#8217; callback URL will trigger an examination of the response to determine whether the User has granted
their approval to Twitter. Assuming so, it may now exchange it&#8217;s unauthorized Request Token for a fully authorized
Access Token by sending a request back to Twitter including the Request Token and the received verification code.
Twitter should now send back a response containing this Access Token which must be used in all requests used to
access Twitter&#8217;s <em>API</em> on behalf of the User. Twitter will only do this once they have confirmed the attached
Request Token has not already been used to retrieve another Access Token. At this point, TweetExpress may confirm
the receipt of the approval to the User and delete the original Request Token which is no longer needed.</p>
<p>From this point forward, TweetExpress may use Twitter&#8217;s <em>API</em> to post new tweets on the User&#8217;s behalf simply by
accessing the <em>API</em> endpoints with a request that has been digitally signed (via HMAC-SHA1) with a combination of
TweetExpress&#8217; Consumer Secret and the Access Key being used.</p>
<p>Although Twitter do not currently expire Access Tokens, the User is free to deauthorize TweetExpress from their
Twitter account settings. Once deauthorized, TweetExpress&#8217; access will be cut off and their Access Token rendered
invalid.</p>

<div class="section" id="security-architecture">
<span id="zendoauth-introduction-security-architecture"></span><h1>Security Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#security-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>OAuth was designed specifically to operate over an insecure <em>HTTP</em> connection and so the use of <em>HTTPS</em> is not
required though obviously it would be desireable if available. Should a <em>HTTPS</em> connection be feasible, OAuth
offers a signature method implementation called PLAINTEXT which may be utilised. Over a typical unsecured <em>HTTP</em>
connection, the use of PLAINTEXT must be avoided and an alternate scheme using. The OAuth specification defines two
such signature methods: HMAC-SHA1 and RSA-SHA1. Both are fully supported by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ZendOAuth</span></tt>.</p>
<p>These signature methods are quite easy to understand. As you can imagine, a PLAINTEXT signature method does nothing
that bears mentioning since it relies on <em>HTTPS</em>. If you were to use PLAINTEXT over <em>HTTP</em>, you are left with a
significant problem: there&#8217;s no way to be sure that the content of any OAuth enabled request (which would include
the OAuth Access Token) was altered en route. This is because unsecured <em>HTTP</em> requests are always at risk of
eavesdropping, Man In The Middle (MITM) attacks, or other risks whereby a request can be retooled so to speak to
perform tasks on behalf of the attacker by masquerading as the origin application without being noticed by the
service provider.</p>
<p>HMAC-SHA1 and RSA-SHA1 alleviate this risk by digitally signing all OAuth requests with the original application&#8217;s
registered Consumer Secret. Assuming only the Consumer and the Provider know what this secret is, a middle-man can
alter requests all they wish - but they will not be able to validly sign them and unsigned or invalidly signed
requests would be discarded by both parties. Digital signatures therefore offer a guarantee that validly signed
requests do come from the expected party and have not been altered en route. This is the core of why OAuth can
operate over an unsecure connection.</p>
<p>How these digital signatures operate depends on the method used, i.e. HMAC-SHA1, RSA-SHA1 or perhaps another method
defined by the service provider. HMAC-SHA1 is a simple mechanism which generates a Message Authentication Code
(MAC) using a cryptographic hash function (i.e. SHA1) in combination with a secret key known only to the message
sender and receiver (i.e. the OAuth Consumer Secret and the authorized Access Key combined). This hashing mechanism
is applied to the parameters and content of any OAuth requests which are concatenated into a &#8220;base signature
string&#8221; as defined by the OAuth specification.</p>
<p>RSA-SHA1 operates on similar principles except that the shared secret is, as you would expect, each parties&#8217; RSA
private key. Both sides would have the other&#8217;s public key with which to verify digital signatures. This does pose a
level of risk compared to HMAC-SHA1 since the RSA method does not use the Access Key as part of the shared secret.
This means that if the RSA private key of any Consumer is compromised, then all Access Tokens assigned to that
Consumer are also. RSA imposes an all or nothing scheme. In general, the majority of service providers offering
OAuth authorization have therefore tended to use HMAC-SHA1 by default, and those who offer RSA-SHA1 may offer
fallback support to HMAC-SHA1.</p>
<p>While digital signatures add to OAuth&#8217;s security they are still vulnerable to other forms of attack, such as replay
attacks which copy earlier requests which were intercepted and validly signed at that time. An attacker can now
resend the exact same request to a Provider at will at any time and intercept its results. This poses a significant
risk but it is quiet simple to defend against - add a unique string (i.e. a nonce) to all requests which changes
per request (thus continually changing the signature string) but which can never be reused because Providers
actively track used nonces within the a certain window defined by the timestamp also attached to a request. You
might first suspect that once you stop tracking a particular nonce, the replay could work but this ignore the
timestamp which can be used to determine a request&#8217;s age at the time it was validly signed. One can assume that a
week old request used in an attempted replay should be summarily discarded!</p>
<p>As a final point, this is not an exhaustive look at the security architecture in OAuth. For example, what if <em>HTTP</em>
requests which contain both the Access Token and the Consumer Secret are eavesdropped? The system relies on at one
in the clear transmission of each unless <em>HTTPS</em> is active, so the obvious conclusion is that where feasible
<em>HTTPS</em> is to be preferred leaving unsecured <em>HTTP</em> in place only where it is not possible or affordable to do so.</p>

<p>With the OAuth protocol explained, let&#8217;s show a simple example of it with source code. Our new Consumer will be
handling Twitter Status submissions. To do so, it will need to be registered with Twitter in order to receive an
OAuth Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. This are utilised to obtain an Access Token before we use the Twitter <em>API</em>
to post a status message.</p>
<p>Assuming we have obtained a key and secret, we can start the OAuth workflow by setting up a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ZendOAuth\Consumer</span></tt>
instance as follows passing it a configuration (either an array or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Zend\Config\Config</span></tt> object).</p>

<p>The callbackUrl is the URI we want Twitter to request from our server when sending information. We&#8217;ll look at this
later. The siteUrl is the base URI of Twitter&#8217;s OAuth <em>API</em> endpoints. The full list of endpoints include
<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token">http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/oauth/access_token">http://twitter.com/oauth/access_token</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/oauth/authorize">http://twitter.com/oauth/authorize</a>. The base siteUrl utilises a convention which maps to these three OAuth
endpoints (as standard) for requesting a request token, access token or authorization. If the actual endpoints of
any service differ from the standard set, these three URIs can be separately set using the methods
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setRequestTokenUrl()</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setAccessTokenUrl()</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setAuthorizeUrl()</span></tt> or the configuration fields
requestTokenUrl, accessTokenUrl and authorizeUrl.</p>
<p>The consumerKey and consumerSecret are retrieved from Twitter when your application is registered for OAuth access.
These also apply to any OAuth enabled service, so each one will provide a key and secret for your application.</p>
<p>All of these configuration options may be set using method calls simply by converting from, e.g. callbackUrl to
setCallbackUrl().</p>
<p>In addition, you should note several other configuration values not explicitly used: requestMethod and
requestScheme. By default, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ZendOAuth\Consumer</span></tt> sends requests as POST (except for a redirect which uses
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GET</span></tt>). The customised client (see later) also includes its authorization by way of a header. Some services may,
at their discretion, require alternatives. You can reset the requestMethod (which defaults to ZendOAuthOauth::POST) to
ZendOAuthOauth::GET, for example, and reset the requestScheme from its default of ZendOAuthOauth::REQUEST_SCHEME_HEADER to
one of ZendOAuthOauth::REQUEST_SCHEME_POSTBODY or ZendOAuthOauth::REQUEST_SCHEME_QUERYSTRING. Typically the defaults should
work fine apart from some exceptional cases. Please refer to the service provider&#8217;s documentation for more details.</p>
<p>The second area of customisation is how <em>HMAC</em> operates when calculating/comparing them for all requests. This is
configured using the signatureMethod configuration field or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setSignatureMethod()</span></tt>. By default this is HMAC-SHA1.
You can set it also to a provider&#8217;s preferred method including RSA-SHA1. For RSA-SHA1, you should also configure
RSA private and public keys via the rsaPrivateKey and rsaPublicKey configuration fields or the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setRsaPrivateKey()</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setRsaPublicKey()</span></tt> methods.</p>
<p>The first part of the OAuth workflow is obtaining a request token. This is accomplished using:</p>

<p>The new request token (an instance of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ZendOAuth\Token\Request</span></tt>) is unauthorized. In order to exchange it for an

<p>The user will now be redirected to Twitter. They will be asked to authorize the request token attached to the
redirect URI&#8217;s query string. Assuming they agree, and complete the authorization, they will be again redirected,
this time to our Callback URL as previously set (note that the callback URL is also registered with Twitter when we
registered our application).</p>
<p>Before redirecting the user, we should persist the request token to storage. For simplicity I&#8217;m just using the
user&#8217;s session, but you can easily use a database for the same purpose, so long as you tie the request token to the
current user so it can be retrieved when they return to our application.</p>
<p>The redirect URI from Twitter will contain an authorized Access Token. We can include code to parse out this access
token as follows - this source code would exist within the executed code of our callback URI. Once parsed we can
discard the previous request token, and instead persist the access token for future use with the Twitter <em>API</em>.
Again, we&#8217;re simply persisting to the user session, but in reality an access token can have a long lifetime so it
should really be stored to a database.</p>

<p>Success! We have an authorized access token - so it&#8217;s time to actually use the Twitter <em>API</em>. Since the access
token must be included with every single <em>API</em> request, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ZendOAuth\Consumer</span></tt> offers a ready-to-go <em>HTTP</em> client
(a subclass of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Zend\Http\Client</span></tt>) to use either by itself or by passing it as a custom <em>HTTP</em> Client to another
library or component. Here&#8217;s an example of using it standalone. This can be done from anywhere in your application,
so long as you can access the OAuth configuration and retrieve the final authorized access token.</p>
