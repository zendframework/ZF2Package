<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Zend\Validator\Barcode</span></tt> allows you to check if a given value can be represented as barcode.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Zend\Validator\Barcode</span></tt> supports multiple barcode standards and can be extended with proprietary barcode
implementations very easily. The following barcode standards are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>CODABAR</strong>: Also known as Code-a-bar.</p>
<p>This barcode has no length limitation. It supports only digits, and 6 special chars. Codabar is a self-checking
barcode. This standard is very old. Common use cases are within airbills or photo labs where multi-part forms are
used with dot-matrix printers.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>CODE128</strong>: CODE128 is a high density barcode.</p>
<p>This barcode has no length limitation. It supports the first 128 ascii characters. When used with printing
characters it has an checksum which is calculated modulo 103. This standard is used worldwide as it supports
upper and lowercase characters.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>CODE25</strong>: Often called &#8220;two of five&#8221; or &#8220;Code25 Industrial&#8221;.</p>
<p>This barcode has no length limitation. It supports only digits, and the last digit can be an optional checksum
which is calculated with modulo 10. This standard is very old and nowadays not often used. Common use cases are
within the industry.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>CODE25INTERLEAVED</strong>: Often called &#8220;Code 2 of 5 Interleaved&#8221;.</p>
<p>This standard is a variant of CODE25. It has no length limitation, but it must contain an even amount of
characters. It supports only digits, and the last digit can be an optional checksum which is calculated with
modulo 10. It is used worldwide and common on the market.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>CODE39</strong>: CODE39 is one of the oldest available codes.</p>
<p>This barcode has a variable length. It supports digits, upper cased alphabetical characters and 7 special

Still, when you provide a checksum, then you should also validate it. By default, these barcode types perform no
checksum validation. By using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">checksum</span></tt> option you can define if the checksum will be validated or ignored.</p>

<div class="section" id="writing-custom-adapters">
<span id="zend-validator-set-barcode-custom"></span><h2>Writing custom adapters<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-custom-adapters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You may write custom barcode validators for usage with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Zend\Validator\Barcode</span></tt>; this is often necessary when
dealing with proprietary barcode types. To write your own barcode validator, you need the following information.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Length</strong>: The length your barcode must have. It can have one of the following values:<ul>
<li><strong>Integer</strong>: A value greater 0, which means that the barcode must have this length.</li>
<li><strong>-1</strong>: There is no limitation for the length of this barcode.</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;even&#8221;</strong>: The length of this barcode must have a even amount of digits.</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;odd&#8221;</strong>: The length of this barcode must have a odd amount of digits.</li>
<li><strong>array</strong>: An array of integer values. The length of this barcode must have one of the set array values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Characters</strong>: A string which contains all allowed characters for this barcode. Also the integer value 128 is
allowed, which means the first 128 characters of the ASCII table.</li>
<li><strong>Checksum</strong>: A string which will be used as callback for a method which does the checksum validation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your custom barcode validator must extend <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Zend\Validator\Barcode\AbstractAdapter</span></tt> or implement
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Zend\Validator\Barcode\AdapterInterface</span></tt>.</p>
<p>As an example, let&#8217;s create a validator that expects an even number of characters that include all digits and the
letters &#8216;ABCDE&#8217;, and which requires a checksum.</p>
